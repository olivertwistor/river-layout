# River Layout

This is a layout manager for Java Swing that is specifically well-suited for creating form-like layouts. It was created by [David Ekholm](https://github.com/davidekholm). 

I made extensive use of it in my own hobby projects back in the day, so I reached out to them to ask if the code was uploaded somewhere I could contribute with my own additions in form of Javadoc. David told me I could upload the code to GitHub myself if I wanted to, and thus this repo came to life.

This was 8+ years ago and I have no interest in further development, partly because I'm transitioning away from Swing towards JavaFX. Therefor I will archive this repo. If it's useful for someone, that's great.
